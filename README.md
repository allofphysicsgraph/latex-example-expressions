# explanation of files

## manually created files

The folder `examples_of_valid_latex` contains manually created valid Latex expressions, one per file:
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_expression_latex.tex`

For each Latex expression there's also a manually created set of expected symbols:
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_expected_tokens.tex`

## aggregation file

The file `examples_of_valid_latex/main.tex` aggregates all the other `*.tex` files into one PDF that a user can then manually review. (`main.tex` is partially generated by `generate_main.py`.)

## generated file content

### SymPy 1.12 with antlr4-python3-runtime 4.11 on raw Latex expression

The content for each file 
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_expression_latex_sympy_112_antlr4-python3-runtime411_expression.tex`
was generated using 
<https://github.com/allofphysicsgraph/sympy-in-docker/blob/main/eval_latex.py>

Similarly, the content for each file 
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_expression_latex_sympy_112_antlr4-python3-runtime411_atoms.tex`
also comes from that same `.py` script.

### SymPy 1.12 with antlr4-python3-runtime 4.11 on clean Latex expression

Sometimes the reason SymPy fails to parse successfully is due to presentation-related spacing. 
By removing the non-essential spacing marks, SymPy is more likely to succeed.

The file
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_cleaned_latex.tex`
is the cleaned version of
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_expression_latex.tex`

Then SymPy 1.12 with antlr4-python3-runtime 4.11 is used on
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_cleaned_latex.tex`
to generate
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_cleaned_latex_sympy_112_antlr4-python3-runtime411_expression.tex`
and
`examples_of_valid_latex/*_cleaned_latex_sympy_112_antlr4-python3-runtime411_atoms.tex`
